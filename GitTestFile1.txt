“You buy furniture. You tell yourself, this is the last sofa I will ever need in my life.
Buy the sofa, then for a couple years you're satisfied that no matter what goes wrong, at 
least you've got your sofa issue handled. Then the right set of dishes. Then the perfect bed. 
The drapes. The rug. Then you're trapped in your lovely nest, and the things you used to own, 
now they own you.” 

“I think that when the lies are all told and forgot the truth will be there yet. It dont move 
about from place to place and it dont change from time to time. You cant corrupt it any more 
than you can salt salt.”
